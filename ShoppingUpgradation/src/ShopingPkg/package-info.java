//problem 1. Duration - 1 hour. submit using your roll number 



You purchase an item online, you want different payment methods such as credit card, debit card, net-banking or cash on delivery.

Write a program that assumes that you have made a purchase of an item and allows you to select a payment method and makes the payment.

It should be possible to select any payment method for a successive transactions with minimum changes to the code.



We need an OO solution to this problem.

You are not supposed to program for selecting an item etc. Assume that you have purchased an item Y with a price X.



A sample main () method that uses this facility is as follows





Main(){



//assume that item details such as price are defined in class Item.

Item item1= new Item();



EComsite flipkart = new EComsite();



flipKart.chosePaymentMethod(“X”);

//X specifies the chosen method



Flipkart.makePayment(item.getPrice());



//similarly you can show different payment method for different items…
