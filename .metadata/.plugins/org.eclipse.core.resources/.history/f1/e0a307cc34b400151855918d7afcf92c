/*
 * 
You purchase an item online, you want different payment methods such as credit card, debit card, net-banking or cash on delivery.

Write a program that assumes that you have made a purchase of an item and allows you to select a payment method and makes the payment.

It should be possible to select any payment method for a successive transactions with minimum changes to the code.



We need an OO solution to this problem.

You are not supposed to program for selecting an item etc. Assume that you have purchased an item Y with a price X.
