Imagine that you have a existing  application that does financial accounitng. 
This application depends on another application that provides income tax calculation. 
Now it is stipulated that a new income tax calculation application is to be used. 
Note that the new implementation has a different interface for income tax calculation  
compared to the existing income tax calculator.

How will you ensure that new income tax calculator is used without (much) changing the  
code of the existing financial application?
