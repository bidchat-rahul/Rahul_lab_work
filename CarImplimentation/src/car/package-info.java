// problem 1. Duration - 1 hour. submit using your roll number 

A car is made up of various subsystems which in turn are made up of individual parts. Each of these parts has a price. The total price of car is sum total of its subsystems which in turn is sum total of its parts. Your program should be able to compute the total price of car. It should first create the Car object with  its subsystems and parts. (please note that a few representative subsystems and parts could be defined. Do not spend time in adding/defining all the parts. )

Ex main() {

//code fragment

   myCar = new Car()

//add subsystems and parts

 

myCar.getPrice();

 

 ....

}
