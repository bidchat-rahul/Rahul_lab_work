Answer all possible questions. Implement following situations using one or more design patterns. 
You may implement them separately or in combined manner wherever possible.
1. A vehicle can be in various states- Idle or moving. It responds to operations such as applyBrake() 
differently in each of this state. Ex. When it is in moving state applyBrake() will result in vehicle 
coming to idle state. When it is in idle state, applyBrake() will have no effect.  (additionally you can 
refine the moving state by adding separate state for each of the gear shift with rules to move sequentially 
from lower to top gear and back).

4. Consider a graphical drawing editor which provides basic shapes such as circle, triangle 
and square as elements for drawing. The editor allows you to embed these elements within one another 
to any depth. Ex. You can create a ring of concentric circles or squares or triangles as well as have a 
circle within a triangle within a square. Possibilities are unlimited.

5. You have an online banking account for your actual bank account. Basic transactions such as 
getBalance(), withdraw( int amount), deposit(int amount) etc can be performed through both these options.
